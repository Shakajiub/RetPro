# Version Changes:

# 1.0.6 - Sound files changed from .wav to .ogg.
# 1.0.6 - Menu buttons are dark gray when disabled (for a brief half
# a second after pressing, to avoid jumping straight back to the game)

# 1.0.5 - Renamed & edited some image files, since colors of any
# surface can now be changed ingame with nice a function.

# 1.0.4 - Moved the changelog to a folder along the other games.
# Only the current version's changes should be written in the game file.

# 1.0.3 - Fixed the menu (exiting to/from it)

# 1.0.2 - Added a feature to release the Ball with spacebar, like in Breakout.
# 1.0.2 - Fixed the correct Player not getting to start after a point.

# 1.0.1 - Rewrote the Ball bouncing from the top and bottom screen edges,
# for there was a glitch where it could potentially get stuck on either one.

# 1.0.0 - First fully working game version.
