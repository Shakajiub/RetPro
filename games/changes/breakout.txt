Version Changes (pre-github)

1.0.6 - Reorganized the code, yet again.

1.0.5 - Sound files changed from .wav to .ogg.
1.0.5 - Reorganized parts of the code, moved stuff here and there.
1.0.5 - All sounds are packed in a single global list.
1.0.5 - Level selection buttons (0-9) go dark after pressing for half a second.

1.0.4 - Changed the way highscores are displayed in the menu.
1.0.4 - Small edits here and there, mainly tweaking the ball bouncing.

1.0.3 - Menu buttons are dark gray when disabled (for a brief half a second after pressing, to avoid "pressing" them again)

1.0.2 - Fixed the highscores button not showing the score from level 0.
1.0.2 - Renamed & edited some image files, since colors of any surface can now be changed ingame with nice a function.

1.0.1 - Moved the changelog to a folder along the other games.
1.0.1 - Can no longer get bonuses/curses with the last remaining Brick.
1.0.1 - A complete rewrite of the damn annoying Ball bouncing. It's now done in an ugly, repeating, non-pythonic, yet foolproof way.

1.0.0 - Game finished. Mostly. Fixed the menu (exiting to/from it).
(The Ball bouncing is still edgy, hope I don't have to code that ever again.)

0.9.9 - Redesigned some levels and rewrote parts of the Ball's bouncing logic.
0.9.9 - Added a new bonus; "Time Distortion", that halves the Ball(s)'s speed.

0.9.8 - Finished the levels, and added a possibility to run a custom function for each one. "level_code_3()" would run (if existed) along level 3, etc.

0.9.6 - Redesigned the menu, added a button to view the high scores.

0.9.4 - The Paddle is now moved with the mouse only.
0.9.4 - Added first versions of the special bonuses/curses, so far just extra Balls and larger/smaller Paddles.

0.9.0 - Initial commenting, fairly well working game overall.
