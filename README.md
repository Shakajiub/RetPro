Sorry, I'm figuring things out, now idea how this all works.


RetPro
======

A "handheld console" with clones of some classic games, written in Python + Pygame. Currently includes Pong, Breakout & Space Invaders.


### Requirements (Windows)

- [Python 3.3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-335) (should work with newer versions without troubles)
- [Pygame 1.9.2](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads) (same here, although I don't think any exit)


### Starting/Playing

Launch RetPro.py, and you should see this (without the game started):

Now drag one of the games from the right side to the slot on top of the console, and press the play-button on the top-left corner of the console to boot it up. You can also freely drag the console itself around the screen. F11 should switch between fullscreen/windowed mode.
