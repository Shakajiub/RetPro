Sorry, I'm figuring things out, now idea how this all works.


# RetPro

A "handheld console" with clones of some legendary, classic games:

- [Pong](#Pong)
- [Breakout](#Breakout)
- [Space Invaders](#Invaders)


### Requirements (Windows)

- [Python 3.3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-335) (should work with newer versions without troubles)
- [Pygame 1.9.2](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads) (same here, although I don't think any exit)

Install them in the above order and you're good to go. Various Linux distros should have these available via whatever package manager they use, although the game hasn't actually been tested on any (sorry!). I do plan on getting it running on Debian/Ubuntu and possibly Arch Linux.


### Starting/Playing

Launch **RetPro.py**, and you should see this (without the game started):

Now drag one of the games from the right side to the slot on top of the console, and press the play-button on the top-left corner of the console to boot it up. You can also freely drag the console itself around the screen. F11 should switch between fullscreen/windowed mode.

#### Breakout
